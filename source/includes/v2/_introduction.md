The Opendatasoft search API v2 is organized around REST. It provides access to all the data available through the platform in a coherent, hierarchical way.

- Only the HTTP `GET` method is supported.
- All API endpoints return JSON.
- Endpoints are organized in a hierarchical way describing the relative relationship between objects.
- All responses contain a list of links allowing easy and relevant navigation through the API endpoints.
- The same internal query language is used for all endpoints of the search API. It means that most of the time, parameters work the same way for all endpoints.
