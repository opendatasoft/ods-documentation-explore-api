The OpenDataSoft search API v2 is organized around REST. It provides access to all the data available through the platform in a coherent, hierarchical way.

- Only the HTTP `GET` method is supported.
- All API endpoints return JSON.
- Endpoints are organized in a hierarchical way describing the relative relationship between objects.
- All responses contain a list of links allowing easy and relevant navigation through the API endpoints.
- The same internal query language is used for all endpoints of the search API. It means that most of the time, parameters work the same way for all endpoints.

The domain https://examples.opendatasoft.com/ will be used by default in all the examples of this documentation.
