The OpenDataSoft management API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses
HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs,
which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.
