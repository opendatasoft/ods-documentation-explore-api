```

The `GetFeature` operation allows retrieval of features from the WFS, and output them using the GML 3.1.1
representation.

### Parameters

This is the list of the supported parameters specific to the `GetFeature` operation. You should also take into
consideration the common parameters. [See here](#parameters).

The existing parameters in the WFS standard that are not listed in this table are currently not supported.

### Response paging

â€‹One of the new features introduced in 2.0.0 of the WFS API is the ability to set pagination for the results of this action. NumberMatched and NumberReturned allow you to determine the total number of results matching the query and the number of results returned, respectively. The "startindex" and "count" parameters are available for this operation and allow you to interact with the paging mechanism. 

It's important to note that enabling paging limits the number of results to 10,000 (**start_index + count must be lower than 10,000**) and is recommended for visualizing extents that contain relatively small amounts of data. In order to get all data, do not use the **count** parameter.
